##  FIClash Features

- **One app for Android, Windows, macOS and Linux**, with x64 and ARM64 builds on the desktop.
- **mihomo (Clash.Meta) core** with rule routing, proxy groups, latency tests, system proxy and TUN mode.
- **Profiles** from a subscription link or a file, with a built-in editor, override scripts, and custom rules,
  proxies and proxy groups.
- **Live views** of connections, requests, DNS queries and logs.
- **Material You design with Apple-style interaction**: dynamic color, light and dark themes, continuous corners,
  sheets that snap between heights, and layouts that adapt from phones to desktops.
- **Backup and restore** through WebDAV or a local file.
- **Platform touches**: a Quick Settings tile, per-app proxy and Android TV support on Android; a tray menu and
  global hotkeys on the desktop.
- **Open source and ad-free**, licensed under GPL-3.0.


**Linux tray icon**

The `.deb` package installs its own dependencies. With the AppImage or the `.rpm`, install the AyatanaAppIndicator
library so the tray icon can show:

```bash
sudo apt-get install libayatana-appindicator3-1   # Debian and Ubuntu
sudo dnf install libayatana-appindicator-gtk3     # Fedora
```

**Unattended desktop**

FlClash starts the core only after the disclaimer is accepted. Where nobody can click it, such as a container, set
`FLCLASH_ACCEPT_DISCLAIMER=1` in the app's environment to accept it on first launch.

## Usage

**Import a profile from a link.** Opening a link in this form imports the subscription into FlClash. The `clashmeta://`
and `flclash://` schemes work the same way.

```text
clash://install-config?url=<URL-encoded subscription link>
```

**Automate on Android.** Tasker, MacroDroid and similar apps can start, stop or toggle the proxy by starting an
activity with one of these actions:

```text
com.follow.clash.action.START
com.follow.clash.action.STOP
com.follow.clash.action.TOGGLE
```

From a computer, the same works over adb:

```bash
adb shell am start -a com.follow.clash.action.TOGGLE
```

## Build from source

You need [Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) 3.47 (release builds use 3.47.6),
[Go](https://go.dev/dl/) 1.27 and [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) installed through rustup. Each platform builds on its own
host, except Android, which builds anywhere.

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/chen08209/FlClash.git
cd FlClash
flutter pub get
dart setup.dart android   # or windows, macos, linux
```

Packages land in `dist/`. The Go core and the Rust libraries are compiled as part of the Flutter build.

| Platform | Also needed |
| --- | --- |
| Android | Android SDK with the NDK. Add `--arch arm64` to build a single ABI. |
| Windows | GCC (MinGW-w64) for the core and [Inno Setup](https://jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php) 6 for the installer. |
| macOS | Xcode and Node.js. The script installs `appdmg` through npm. |
| Linux | Debian or Ubuntu. The script installs the build packages with apt and downloads `appimagetool`. |

Run `dart setup.dart --help` for the remaining options, such as `--targets` to build only some package formats.
